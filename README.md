# Model Generator 

This project is an early-stage tool for generating customizable models (**containers** and **vertical laptop holders** only right now). With the program, you can define the sizes of your models, visualize them, and export them to **STL files** for 3D printing.  

**⚠️ Note:**  
This project is in a **very early stage of development**. It is not yet optimized, and some features may not work as expected. Feedback and patience are highly appreciated as the project evolves!

## Features  

- **Model Generation**  
  Generate custom **containers** and **vertical laptop holders** with adjustable dimensions.  

- **STL Export**  
  Export generated models to **STL format**, ready for 3D printing.  

- **AppImage for Linux**  
  The program is packaged as an **AppImage** for easy testing on Linux systems. Simply download and run it without installation.

## How to Use  

1. **Run the AppImage**  
   - Download the AppImage file from the project folder.  
   - Make it executable:  
     ```bash
     chmod +x ChePa-x86_64.AppImage
     ```  
   - Launch the program:  
     ```bash
     ./ChePa-x86_64.AppImage
     ```  

2. **Generate Models**  
   - Select the type of model to create: **Container** or **Vertical Laptop Holder**.  
   - Adjust the size and dimensions using the program’s interface.  

3. **Export as STL**  
   - After adjusting a model, export it as an **STL file**.  
   - The exported file can be used directly with 3D printing software.

## Limitations  

- **Work in Progress**: This project is far from complete. Expect bugs and rough edges.  
- **Linux Only**: Currently, only an **AppImage** for Linux is provided.
